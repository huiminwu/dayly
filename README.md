## Borrowed code:

The code for the Notebook and Collections editors are based off the official DraftJS examples of rich text and color text editors (https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/tree/master/examples/draft-0-10-0/rich and https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/tree/master/examples/draft-0-10-0/color, respectively). The Notebook editor also borrows a key binding map function from https://draftjs.org/docs/advanced-topics-key-bindings/#defaults.

The code for the dropdown menu in the editor toolbar is based off of this tutorial: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/do-you-even-draft-pumping-up-font-sizes-in-draft-js-9582c421bc55.
